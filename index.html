                    The reason I'm putting this machine at the number one spot is because they're revolutionary for not just Apple's laptop computers, but for the entire computer industry as a whole.
                    With the original M1 chip, Apple had already proven that they could make a reasonably powerful chip that consumes very little power. With the M1X they have taken this to a totally new level. Apple showed us that laptops can indeed be top-class pro machines while still being fairly portable and silent!
                    Besides that we also got a complete redesign of these machines after around five long years! In my opinion, the redesign was very focused on practicality rather than aesthetics. Not that these MacBooks are ugly, certainly not (there is a lot of controversy about the notch and thickness though!). But the more round shape of the bottom just makes the MacBook easier to hold. The thin bezels at their turn allowed for a larger screen without impacting the real size of the machine too much and the return of some ports is clearly a practical move as well. Apple basically did the exact opposite of what they did in 2016.
                    Add to all of that the new mini-LED screen technology, a 120Hz refresh rate and the returned MagSafe charger and you get yourself a dream computer that will be extremely hard to beat in the future!.

                <p>
                    This device is deservedly number two on our list! It has undergone the most drastic makeover of its entire life â€” and actually of all devices â€” this year! Since 2012, the design of the iPad Mini had been unchanged. But that finally changed! After the iPad Air in 2020, the iPad Mini got the so-called iPad Pro look too. With this new design also came a new Touch-ID sensor in the power button and Apple Pencil 2 support.
                    The Mini also got the A15 bionic chip, a better camera and a flash light which wasn't present before. All of this finally made this tablet worth it again in comparison to the other iPads in the line-up.

                <p>
                    The reason I put this machine so high on the list, is again because of the redesign it has undergone this year. (You're probably starting to see a pattern here ðŸ˜…). Until 2021, the iMac basically looked the exact same ever since 2009 (some might even say ever since 2007). This year that changed drastically. I would even say this new iMac looks nothing like the previous one.
                    Not only did the black bezels turn into white ones, but the amount of colors got increased by a lot. Now you're not limited to silver/grey anymore (or spacegrey if you consider the iMac Pro).
                    Moving on, the Apple logo on the front has been removed, as the design is now more than good enough for brand awareness. However, the logo on the back has become larger and the color of the back is much more lively than the color of the front.
                    Finally, the screen size has been increased from 21" to 24". This new iMac is also super thin for an all-in-one desktop. In addition, this Mac comes with the incredible M1 chip and has a 4.5K 60Hz LCD display which is absolutely great for almost everyone. This machine is basically the happy, fast, colorful iMac for the basic needs at home you've always wanted!

                    The AirPods definitely deserve a mention in this list at spot #4. After all, Apple doesn't refresh them too often and this model is actually the first time the original AirPods saw a redesign. The AirPods 2 were a joke in my opinion and the AirPods Pro are considered a different category in this case. It really seems like I have an obsession with redesigns ðŸ˜‚. But the truth is that they are often the most obvious change that a device can undergo.
                    The improvements were not only design wise though! The audio quality got improved to a level similar to that of AirPods Pro. The AirPods 3 also got spatial audio and Adaptive EQ which were both not available on the second generation. The last big changes were the intoduction of the force sensor controls like the AirPods Pro and the sweat and water resistance present for the first time ever on any model if I'm not mistaken. It is also possible now to charge these AiPods via MagSafe.

                    Of course the new iPhones are in this list! I knew you were waiting for them to appear! But to be honest, I think the iPhone upgrades are getting a little boring these last couple of years. The last design change for example from the 11 to the 12 â€” which I really did like by the way â€” still seemed to be change for the sake of change.
                    Don't get me wrong though! With all the 13 models, Apple ones again proved to us that they could still improve a lot of things! The lenses of the iPhone got bigger, all got sensor shift image stabilisation and cinematic mode was introduced for all iPhone 13 models with at least 256GB. In addition, the notch got smaller, the battery life was improved and all displays are Super Retina XDR now. The Pro models also got 120Hz â€” which was long overdue â€” and all models got the fancy new and more efficient A15 Bionic chip of course.Of course the new iPhones are in this list!

                <p>
                    This is actually my favorite Apple product. I find the concept of a tablet really amazing and I use an iPad Pro 2017 every single day for studying (in Notability or GoodNotes), browsing the web, watching YouTube and for doing some light gaming. I even edited all my YouTube videos for more than a year on my iPad with LumaFusion (amazing app btw and not sponsored lol).
                    Although I'm clearly a big fan of the iPad, I still didn't put these new models with their M1 chip that high on the list for the simple reason that they weren't actually that big of an improvement. I admit, the new M1 chip is very cool. Apple put a 'desktop-class chip' in the iPad Pros. But most of us probably know that it is actually the other way around. Apple put an iPad Pro chip in the Mac, but rebranded it as a new type of Mac chip. After they had done that, they could then put a 'desktop-class chip' in the iPad Pros, which is actually a genius move marketing wise.
                    There are a few actual improvements though! The 12.9" iPad Pro got a new type of display: Mini LED. But unfortunately the 11" was not invited to that party. If not for that lack, I would have probably bought that device. Apart from that both machines saw a significant increase in ram.
                    We also have to mention a few more negative things about these iPads. The first one is the significant price increase the 12.9" iPad Pro saw (I think it was an additional 100 bucks. The price of the 11" fortunately remained the same). The 12" also got a little bit heavier and the Mini LED technology can cause a slight 'blooming' effect on the display, especially on text in the dark.
                    The last negative thing is the lack of professional software. In 2019 Apple introduced 'iPadOS' because the software of the iPhone and iPad were 'diverging' in their opinion. But I have to say that I haven't really seen much apart from that renaming. iPadOS is still mainly a blown-up version of iOS and there are still no real pro apps available on the operating system despite the hardware clearly allowing for it. The iPad Pro is therefore in a precarious position, especially if you consider the value of the M1 MacBook Air.

                <p>
                    The last device on our list is the Apple Watch Series 7. I should maybe have put it a little higher, but I just am not really convinced by it. But to be honest, I have not used the device myself so I should not judge it too much.
                    Basically I just was really disappointed when I saw the new design since I expected a squared off design like many leakers had been suggesting for months before the release.
                    Some people do really like the real new design though. They say that a squared off design would not have been comfortable and maybe they are right. But I still think that this Apple Watch was a last minute improvised stunt of Apple because their original one had production issues. The watch didn't even get a new chip, only in name. That's why I put it so low on the list, but it is still on the list.

            BONUS: Products that didn't make it into the top 7!
        </h5>
            If I counted right, I only left out two products in my top seven since Apple 'only' released nine this year. So to give them a fair chance, I will mention them here as a bonus.
            iPad (9th generation)
            It's not at all that this product is bad. On the contrary! If you were to make a list of Apple's best value products, then this device is definitely somewhere at the top. But it just isn't really exciting since the changes year over year are so small.
            Apple TV 4K (2nd generation)
            This is definitely the most boring product Apple has released this year. It's basically the same TV box as the one released in 2017. Nothing has changed design wise and the chip has been 'upgraded' from an A10X to an A12, which isn't really an upgrade. In many benchmarks, the GPU of the A10X appears to be faster than the one of the A12. In short, the worst product Apple has released this year. Fortunately, there was only one of these, at least in my opinion. ðŸ˜„
